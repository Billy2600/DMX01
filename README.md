# DMX01
A maze game that uses randomly generated mazes. It uses the depth-first search algorithm to generate mazes. This was created in C++ with the SFML graphics library, using Visual Studio 2013 and it is my first game using C++11. Requires the VC++ Redistributable 2013 to run. The name has no special meaning, it's just random letters and numbers. Use the arrow keys to get to the red square. Requires SFML 2.1. SFML will have to be recompiled for Visual studio 2013.
